# Other assets

**This directory is not required, you can delete it if you don't want to use it.**

This directory contains files which should not be served statically (`static`) or served through Webpack (`assets`).
Instead they get transposed to serve a different purpose.

For example, SVGs are transposed using `vue-inline-svg-loader` into the html files.
